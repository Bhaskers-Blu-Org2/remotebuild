# taco-remote-multiplexer

*taco-remote-multiplexer* is a package which is intended to update when there is a breaking change in Apache Cordova, or we want to support different incompatible features. Given a build request, it specifies what package should build it. Currently it specifies *taco-remote-lib@1.0.0* but this may change in future.
